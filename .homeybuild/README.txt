Use Homey to control your Yeelights over your local network (LAN). All Yeelight products that communicate over WiFi are supported by this app.

Adding Yeelights
Before being able to add your Yeelights as devices in Homey you will need to enable the "Developer Mode" or "LAN control" in the official Yeelight app. You can find this under the "settings" of your light within the Yeelight smartphone app.
